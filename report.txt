Code vulnerabilities include plain text passwords, weak session management, 
CSRF risk, input validation gaps, improper redirects, sensitive data exposure, 
and lacking password policies. 


To improve security we need to:

Hash and salt passwords securely.
Configure secure session settings and use a session store.
Implement CSRF protection.
Apply input validation.
Validate and sanitize redirect URLs.
Enhance session security and user authentication.
Enforce password policies."
